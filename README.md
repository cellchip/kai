## Introduction To UAN
### Financial Challenges Under Natural Disaster
Over the past ten years, there have been more than 30 devastating earthquakes worldwide. During the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, one of the largest earthquakes in human history, Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) offered immediate aid and financial services to victims. To better understand their needs, we interviewed employees who experienced the rescue, and learned 4 pain points:

1. Cash and cards are lost during the earthquake, unable to meet daily needs.
2. People concern about their account security, so they want to inquire and report 	the loss asap. 
3. PhotoID are lost, unable to get authentication. 
4. Out of touch with relatives, and can’t get financial support.

### UNA: Cash Withdrawal With FaceID
In recent years, ABC and many other banks in China started to adopt facial recognition technology. At present, 12,000 ABC’s ATMs enabled facial recognition to withdraw cash, and the daily transaction volume has reached 25,000. However, this still didn’t solve the above four pain points, because people can’t withdraw cash from their relative’s accounts if their bank cards are issued by different banks or they are in foreign countries. To address this issue, ABC develops United Aid Net solution. Based on facial recognition withdrawal, UAN allows temporary shared financial services among family members or friends during disasters.

### What Is the "United Aid Net"?
UAN is composed of Institution Network and Family Network. Institution Network consists of financial and government institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, securities, FinTech enterprises, government departments, global relief groups, and UN organizations. Family Network consists of parents, spouse, offspring, other relatives, friends and so on.

### Institution Network and Family Network
Institutions need to apply and sign convention to join UAN. Customers need to sign agreements and identify relatives as beneficiaries through the banking app. By providing his name, ID number, telephone, relationship information and FaceID, a customer can easily link his bank accounts with beneficiaries’. How UAN triggers? When a disaster happens, government will launch an official announcement, claim disaster area scope and confirm the affected period. Then it enables UAN services. Financial institutions in UAN provide financial services such as petty cash withdrawals, inquiries, reporting loss and inter-bank clearance. For customers, the beneficiaries can use UAN emergency service and facial recognition to withdraw small amount of cash through UAN alliances’ ATMs. The inter-bank transaction bills for emergency withdrawals will be cleared and maintained through the UAN blockchain network supported by Hyperledger.
