## Introduction To UAN

### Financial Challenges After Natural Disasters
Over the past ten years, there have been more than 30 devastating earthquakes worldwide. During the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, one of the largest earthquakes in human history, Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) offered immediate aid and financial services to victims. To better understand their needs, we interviewed employees who experienced the disaster, and learned about 4 pain points:

1. Cash and cards are often lost during the earthquake, which leaves them unable to meet daily needs.
2. People have concerns about their account security, so they want to inquire and report the loss as soon as possible. 
3. Their Photo IDs are lost, which leaves them unable to provide authentication. 
4. They have lost touch with relatives, and therefore can’t access financial support.

### United Aid Net: Cash Withdrawal With FaceID

In recent years, ABC and many other banks in China have started to adopt facial recognition technology. At present, around 12,000 of ABC’s ATMs use facial recognition to withdraw cash, and the daily transaction volume has reached to 25,000. However, this still hasn’t solved the four pain points above, because people can’t withdraw cash from their relative’s accounts if their bank cards are issued by different banks or if they are in foreign countries. To address this issue, ABC has developed the United Aid Net (UAN) solution as part of the [Call for Code](https://callforcode.org/) challenge. Based on facial recognition, the UAN allows temporary shared financial services among family members or friends during disasters.

### What Is the United Aid Net?

The UAN is comprised of two parts, an Institution Network and a Family Network. The Institution Network consists of financial and government institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, securities, FinTech enterprises, government departments, global relief groups, and United Nations organizations. The Family Network consists of parents, spouse, offspring, other relatives, friends and so on.

### Institution Network and Family Network

Institutions need to apply and sign a convention to join the UAN. Customers need to sign agreements and identify relatives as beneficiaries through the banking app. By providing his or her name, ID number, telephone, relationship information and FaceID, a customer can easily link his or her bank accounts with his or her beneficiaries’ accounts. 

#### How does UAN work? 

When a disaster happens, the government will launch an official announcement, define the disaster area scope, and confirm the affected period. It then enables the UAN services. 

Financial institutions in the UAN provide financial services such as small cash withdrawals, inquiries, reporting loss and inter-bank clearance. 

For customers, the beneficiaries can then use the UAN emergency service through facial recognition to withdraw a small amount of cash through the UAN alliances' ATMs. 

The inter-bank transaction bills for emergency withdrawals will be cleared and maintained through the UAN blockchain network supported by Hyperledger.
